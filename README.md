TO RUN ON YOUR OWN MACHINE: DOWNLOAD THE DATASET AND ADD THE DIRECTORY TO THE PATH VARIABLE.

ALL CODE OUTPUTS AND VISUALIZATIONS CREATED SHOW ALREADY BE VIEWABLE BUT IF NOT RUN ON MACHINE JUST IN CASE!!

# Data Analysis of Credit Risk Dataset and Predictive Machine Learning Models for Creditworthiness (95% Accuracy, F1 Score)

## Goals:

1. **Understand the Data**: This involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure, identifying the different variables, their types, and distributions.

2. **Clean the Data**: Preprocessing and data cleaning are essential to ensure the data is suitable for analysis. This step includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming variables as needed.

3. **Perform Statistical Analysis on the Data**: This step aims to answer the questions posed in the analysis by conducting relevant statistical tests, exploring correlations between variables, and identifying any patterns or trends that might exist.

4. **Exploratory Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to gain deeper insights into the relationships between variables, identify any data patterns, and present the findings in a clear and understandable manner.

6. **Create Data Preprocessing Function**: Develop a function that imports the dataset and performs data wrangling tasks, including handling missing values, data transformations and handle outliers. This function will return the clean dataset.

7. **Develop Models**:  Predict Credit Risk with High Accuracy and F1 Score, Precision etc.
